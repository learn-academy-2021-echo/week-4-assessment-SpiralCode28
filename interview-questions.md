# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What are props in React?

Your answer: Props, within React, are properties that can be accessed when you need the attributes/value which are assigned to it. One way you can access the attributes/value of the (we'll think of it as a => 'placeholder'), which can be called through dot notation.

Researched answer: Props in functions are considered and are passed into react componets via HTML attributes. Props can be accessed as an entire object or destructured into sepeerate variables. We can use the dot notation to gain access to the value of the props.

2. What is a DOM event?

Your answer:
Let's start off with what a DOM stands for - Document Object Model. A DOM event happens when the user interacts with the user interface. An example of that is when you or I click the "Next" or "Previous" buttons to navigate the user interface or if the up or down arrows are clicked. The ONLY way the user gets to interact with the user interface is through a DOM event.

Researched answer:
DOM events can be triggered with interactions with the UI. DOM events are an object that is generally shortened to (e) as an arguement. Dom events are notification of changes made by the user or in the browser.

3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer:

a. Object-oriented programming or OOP, is a "style" of programming that follows the concept of objects that contain both data and code to modify the data. -- An example of when I used OOP, was in one of my projects I worked on over winter break, called "light bulb challenge" which was in React.

b. OOP is different from functional programming (or FP) because functional programming consists of logic and functions. Objects store information, while functions do not and depend ONLY on the input arguments.

Researched answer:
OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software around data and logics rather than functions or logic. FP uses immutable (data cannot be changed) data whereas OOP use mutable (changeable) data.

Four pillars of OOP:

- encapsualation - The storage of information within an object
- inheritance - The passage of properties and methods to a child object.
- polymorphism - A class/object can represent many things with the same configuration.
- obstraction - Only use the needed information within an object and nothing more

4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:
Let me define what a float and an integer are when we are talking about Ruby:

A float represents a real number and can be a rational or an irrational number. An integer is a whole number which can be positive or negative.

For example -- If I type 301 in Ruby, it's considered an integer. If I edit that integer by adding a decimal making it 301.976 Ruby says it's an float. Anything with a decimal, even if it is 1024.00 it is a float.

Researched answer:
Integers are Whole numbers that are positive negative and zero. Floats contains decimal points, can be rational (having a set number of decimal points(ex. 5.55) or irration (having an infinate number of decimal points ex 3.33...) or can contain fractional parts.

5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:
Every block in ruby will return the value of the last line automatically. I have used the implicit return in one of my groups' past project, which was a text based game. It looks VERY clean and minimalistic. At the moment, I tend to enter my end at the same time as the def when starting a method. I look forward to it once I adapt my own style of how I like to write syntax.

Researched answer:
Ruby will return the last line of any method without explicitly stating the key word return. Some of the cohort group used implicit returns in the text based game -- using the abort method when a player died and passing a message to be displayed.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable:
   type of variable that starts with the @ symbol. it is used in OOP to give objects their own private place to store data.

2. PostgreSQL:
   An open source DB system that supports relational and non-relational querying.

3. Ruby on Rails:
   It's an open-source software which is used to build web applications. Rails is considered a full-stack framework that.

4. ORM:
   Object Relational Mapping is used to convert data from incompatible type using OOP. This can be used within the language DB such as SQL are not OOP and can only store Scaler Data which requires objects to be deconstructed and reconstructed to be used.

5. Active Record:
   In Active Record, objects carry both persistent data and behavior which operates on that data.
